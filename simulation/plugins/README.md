# Simulation Plugins

This directory will contain plugins for extending simulator functionality:

- Hydrodynamics plugins
- Wind and current simulation
- Sensor simulation (GPS, IMU, LIDAR, cameras)
- Energy consumption models
- Communication system simulation

Plugins will be designed for Gazebo and integrate with ROS 2.
