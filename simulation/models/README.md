# Simulation Models

This directory will contain 3D models and physical properties for the simulation environment:

- ASV vessel models (different types)
- Environmental objects (buoys, docks, etc.)
- Terrain and bathymetric models
- Static obstacle models

Models will be compatible with Gazebo simulator and include both visual and collision properties.

*Note: This is a placeholder for future implementation.*
