# Simulation Worlds

This directory will contain world definitions for ASV simulation:

- Harbor environments
- Open water scenarios
- Coastal regions
- Obstacle courses for testing
- Real-world mapped environments

Worlds will be defined in Gazebo/SDF format and include environmental features like water currents and wind patterns.
